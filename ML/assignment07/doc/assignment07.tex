\section{}
There are thousands of classifiers that we can choose. There isn't any classifier that is optimal universally.
The most important criteria is that the classifier must fit the application (data).

If we have labelled data, we can test a classifier using cross-validation.
Then, the precision, recall and f-measure can be compared.

Depending on different application, precision and recall can be of different importance. Therefore, choose a classifier that fit the requirement of the application.

In this experiment we choose four classifiers:
\begin{itemize}
  \item kNN
  \item Linear SVM
  \item RBF kernel SVM
  \item ID3 Dicision Tree
\end{itemize}
